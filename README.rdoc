== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
